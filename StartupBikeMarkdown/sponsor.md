##Interested in spnosoring a ride?





###Here are the details for you to sponsor a Startup Bike meetup

- **Participants**. Typically about 30 people attend an event.  Some of us are tech enthusiasts, others work at tech companies big and small.  Anyone is welcome.

- **Date**. We have a meetup once a month; we're flexible on the specific date, as long as it's a Mon/Tues/Wed/Thurs since it's an after-work event.  Just let us know which day works best for you.

- **Timing**. The meetup always starts at City Hall (near Civic Center BART) at 6.30pm. We ride at 7pm and should arrive at the sponsor around 8-8.30pm for food & drinks. We'll leave by 9.30pm, but can leave sooner if needed.

- **Food & drinks**. It's up to you how fancy you want to be -- some sponsors just serve pizza and beer while others have nice catering and hand out schwag.  Our meetup members are there for the startup and the bicycling; the food & schwag are just 'nice to have.'

- **Co-host**. [An organizer](http://www.meetup.com/Startup-Bike-SF/members/?op=leaders) will lead the ride, but we'll need someone from your company as a point person to coordinate our visit and talk about your work.  

- **Bike parking**. We'll need a secure space to park our bikes.  

- **Sponsors blurb**. Please provide a blurb about your company that we can share on our meetup page. Some sponsors use this opportunity to offer a promotion -- [Vint](https://www.joinvint.com/) did this in our [March 2015 meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Startup-Bike-SF/events/220106696/)  

- **Ride route**. [An organizer](http://www.meetup.com/Startup-Bike-SF/members/?op=leaders) will plan the route; however, if there are any landmarks/roads/etc near your office that you think are worth visiting, we're always open to suggestions.

- **Startup Bike's blurb**.  Here's a blurb that you can share in your office: 

*Do you like startups? bicycles? Then come join us!*  

*Once a month we do a fun, easy bike ride followed by free dinner & beer at a cool San Francisco startup company. Companies we've visited include Asana, Dropcam, Indiegogo, and Venmo.*
